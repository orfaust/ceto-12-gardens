# Ceto and the 12 Secret Gardens
Platformer built with Godot Engine.
Developed during November 2024 for itch.io's [Game Off 2024](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024)

Tribute to my great friend Vincent, known to his friends as "Ceto" with whom I have been living since 2013.

The game takes place across 12 gardens, one for each month of the year.
In each garden, Ceto must find the potion that, once consumed, will allow him to see the slimes infesting the garden. Along the way, he will encounter various croquettes. By eating them all, he will earn one of the 9 lives he has available.
He must use the poisonous mushrooms to eliminate all the slimes. Once the mission is completed, he can finally rest on his favorite pillow before moving on to the next garden.
At the end of the 12th level, a small final surprise awaits you.
In each level, you will earn points, which will decrease as time passes. At the end of the game, you will be able to save your score.
